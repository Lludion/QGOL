     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, filename, mode='a', encoding=None, delay=False)
     |      Open the specified file and use it as the stream for logging.
     |  
     |  __repr__(self)
     |      Return repr(self).
     |  
     |  close(self)
     |      Closes the stream.
     |  
     |  emit(self, record)
     |      Emit a record.
     |      
     |      If the stream was not opened because 'delay' was specified in the
     |      constructor, open it before calling the superclass's emit.

     |  Methods inherited from Handler:
     |  
     |  acquire(self)
     |      Acquire the I/O thread lock.
     |  
     |  createLock(self)
     |      Acquire a thread lock for serializing access to the underlying I/O.
     |  
     |  format(self, record)
     |      Format the specified record.
     |      
     |      If a formatter is set, use it. Otherwise, use the default formatter
     |      for the module.
     |  
     |  get_name(self)
     |  
     |  handle(self, record)
     |      Conditionally emit the specified logging record.
     |      
     |      Emission depends on filters which may have been added to the handler.
     |      Wrap the actual emission of the record with acquisition/release of
     |      the I/O thread lock. Returns whether the filter passed the record for
     |      emission.
     |  
     |  handleError(self, record)
     |      Handle errors which occur during an emit() call.
     |      
     |      This method should be called from handlers when an exception is
     |      encountered during an emit() call. If raiseExceptions is false,
     |      exceptions get silently ignored. This is what is mostly wanted
     |      for a logging system - most users will not care about errors in
     |      the logging system, they are more interested in application errors.
     |      You could, however, replace this with a custom handler if you wish.
     |      The record which was being processed is passed in to this method.
     |  
     |  release(self)
     |      Release the I/O thread lock.
     |  
     |  setFormatter(self, fmt)
     |      Set the formatter for this handler.
     |  
     |  setLevel(self, level)
     |      Set the logging level of this handler.  level must be an int or a str.

     |  addFilter(self, filter)
     |      Add the specified filter to this handler.
     |  
     |  filter(self, record)
     |      Determine if a record is loggable by consulting all the filters.
     |      
     |      The default is to allow the record to be logged; any filter can veto
     |      this and the record is then dropped. Returns a zero value if a record
     |      is to be dropped, else non-zero.
     |      
     |      .. versionchanged:: 3.2
     |      
     |         Allow filters to be just callables.

    class Filter(builtins.object)
     |  Filter instances are used to perform arbitrary filtering of LogRecords.
     |  
     |  Loggers and Handlers can optionally use Filter instances to filter
     |  records as desired. The base filter class only allows events which are
     |  below a certain point in the logger hierarchy. For example, a filter
     |  initialized with "A.B" will allow events logged by loggers "A.B",
     |  "A.B.C", "A.B.C.D", "A.B.D" etc. but not "A.BB", "B.A.B" etc. If
     |  initialized with the empty string, all events are passed.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, name='')
     |      Initialize a filter.
     |      
     |      Initialize with the name of the logger which, together with its
     |      children, will have its events allowed through the filter. If no
     |      name is specified, allow every event.
     |  
     |  filter(self, record)
     |      Determine if the specified record is to be logged.
     |      
     |      Is the specified record to be logged? Returns 0 for no, nonzero for
     |      yes. If deemed appropriate, the record may be modified in-place.

    class Formatter(builtins.object)
     |  Formatter instances are used to convert a LogRecord to text.
     |  
     |  Formatters need to know how a LogRecord is constructed. They are
     |  responsible for converting a LogRecord to (usually) a string which can
     |  be interpreted by either a human or an external system. The base Formatter
     |  allows a formatting string to be specified. If none is supplied, the
     |  the style-dependent default value, "%(message)s", "{message}", or
     |  "${message}", is used.
     |  
     |  The Formatter can be initialized with a format string which makes use of
     |  knowledge of the LogRecord attributes - e.g. the default value mentioned
     |  above makes use of the fact that the user's message and arguments are pre-
     |  formatted into a LogRecord's message attribute. Currently, the useful
     |  attributes in a LogRecord are described by:
     |  
     |  %(name)s            Name of the logger (logging channel)
     |  %(levelno)s         Numeric logging level for the message (DEBUG, INFO,
     |                      WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
     |  %(levelname)s       Text logging level for the message ("DEBUG", "INFO",
     |                      "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL")
     |  %(pathname)s        Full pathname of the source file where the logging
     |                      call was issued (if available)
     |  %(filename)s        Filename portion of pathname
     |  %(module)s          Module (name portion of filename)
     |  %(lineno)d          Source line number where the logging call was issued
     |                      (if available)
     |  %(funcName)s        Function name
     |  %(created)f         Time when the LogRecord was created (time.time()
     |                      return value)
     |  %(asctime)s         Textual time when the LogRecord was created
     |  %(msecs)d           Millisecond portion of the creation time
     |  %(relativeCreated)d Time in milliseconds when the LogRecord was created,
     |                      relative to the time the logging module was loaded
     |                      (typically at application startup time)
     |  %(thread)d          Thread ID (if available)
     |  %(threadName)s      Thread name (if available)
     |  %(process)d         Process ID (if available)
     |  %(message)s         The result of record.getMessage(), computed just as
     |                      the record is emitted
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, fmt=None, datefmt=None, style='%')
     |      Initialize the formatter with specified format strings.
     |      
     |      Initialize the formatter either with the specified format string, or a
     |      default as described above. Allow for specialized date formatting with
     |      the optional datefmt argument. If datefmt is omitted, you get an
     |      ISO8601-like (or RFC 3339-like) format.
     |      
     |      Use a style parameter of '%', '{' or '$' to specify that you want to
     |      use one of %-formatting, :meth:`str.format` (``{}``) formatting or
     |      :class:`string.Template` formatting in your format string.
     |      
     |      .. versionchanged:: 3.2
     |         Added the ``style`` parameter.
     |  
     |  converter = localtime(...)
     |      localtime([seconds]) -> (tm_year,tm_mon,tm_mday,tm_hour,tm_min,
     |                                tm_sec,tm_wday,tm_yday,tm_isdst)
     |      
     |      Convert seconds since the Epoch to a time tuple expressing local time.
     |      When 'seconds' is not passed in, convert the current time instead.
     |  
     |  format(self, record)
     |      Format the specified record as text.
     |      
     |      The record's attribute dictionary is used as the operand to a
     |      string formatting operation which yields the returned string.
     |      Before formatting the dictionary, a couple of preparatory steps
     |      are carried out. The message attribute of the record is computed
     |      using LogRecord.getMessage(). If the formatting string uses the
     |      time (as determined by a call to usesTime(), formatTime() is
     |      called to format the event time. If there is exception information,
     |      it is formatted using formatException() and appended to the message.
     |  
     |  formatException(self, ei)
     |      Format and return the specified exception information as a string.
     |      
     |      This default implementation just uses
     |      traceback.print_exception()
     |  
     |  formatMessage(self, record)
     |  
     |  formatStack(self, stack_info)
     |      This method is provided as an extension point for specialized
     |      formatting of stack information.
     |      
     |      The input data is a string as returned from a call to
     |      :func:`traceback.print_stack`, but with the last trailing newline
     |      removed.
     |      
     |      The base implementation just returns the value passed in.
     |  
     |  formatTime(self, record, datefmt=None)
     |      Return the creation time of the specified LogRecord as formatted text.
     |      
     |      This method should be called from format() by a formatter which
     |      wants to make use of a formatted time. This method can be overridden
     |      in formatters to provide for any specific requirement, but the
     |      basic behaviour is as follows: if datefmt (a string) is specified,
     |      it is used with time.strftime() to format the creation time of the
     |      record. Otherwise, an ISO8601-like (or RFC 3339-like) format is used.
     |      The resulting string is returned. This function uses a user-configurable
     |      function to convert the creation time to a tuple. By default,
     |      time.localtime() is used; to change this for a particular formatter
     |      instance, set the 'converter' attribute to a function with the same
     |      signature as time.localtime() or time.gmtime(). To change it for all
     |      formatters, for example if you want all logging times to be shown in GMT,
     |      set the 'converter' attribute in the Formatter class.
     |  
     |  usesTime(self)
     |      Check if the format uses the creation time of the record.

    class Handler(Filterer)
     |  Handler instances dispatch logging events to specific destinations.
     |  
     |  The base handler class. Acts as a placeholder which defines the Handler
     |  interface. Handlers can optionally use Formatter instances to format
     |  records as desired. By default, no formatter is specified; in this case,
     |  the 'raw' message as determined by record.message is logged.

     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, level=0)
     |      Initializes the instance - basically setting the formatter to None
     |      and the filter list to empty.
     |  
     |  __repr__(self)
     |      Return repr(self).
     |  
     |  acquire(self)
     |      Acquire the I/O thread lock.
     |  
     |  close(self)
     |      Tidy up any resources used by the handler.
     |      
     |      This version removes the handler from an internal map of handlers,
     |      _handlers, which is used for handler lookup by name. Subclasses
     |      should ensure that this gets called from overridden close()
     |      methods.

     |  createLock(self)
     |      Acquire a thread lock for serializing access to the underlying I/O.
     |  
     |  emit(self, record)
     |      Do whatever it takes to actually log the specified logging record.
     |      
     |      This version is intended to be implemented by subclasses and so
     |      raises a NotImplementedError.
     |  
     |  flush(self)
     |      Ensure all logging output has been flushed.
     |      
     |      This version does nothing and is intended to be implemented by
     |      subclasses.
     |  
     |  format(self, record)
     |      Format the specified record.
     |      
     |      If a formatter is set, use it. Otherwise, use the default formatter
     |      for the module.
     |  
     |  get_name(self)
     |  
     |  handle(self, record)
     |      Conditionally emit the specified logging record.
     |      
     |      Emission depends on filters which may have been added to the handler.
     |      Wrap the actual emission of the record with acquisition/release of
     |      the I/O thread lock. Returns whether the filter passed the record for
     |      emission.
     |  
     |  handleError(self, record)
     |      Handle errors which occur during an emit() call.
     |      
     |      This method should be called from handlers when an exception is
     |      encountered during an emit() call. If raiseExceptions is false,

    class Logger(Filterer)
     |  Instances of the Logger class represent a single logging channel. A
     |  "logging channel" indicates an area of an application. Exactly how an
     |  "area" is defined is up to the application developer. Since an
     |  application can have any number of areas, logging channels are identified
     |  by a unique string. Application areas can be nested (e.g. an area
     |  of "input processing" might include sub-areas "read CSV files", "read
     |  XLS files" and "read Gnumeric files"). To cater for this natural nesting,
     |  channel names are organized into a namespace hierarchy where levels are
     |  separated by periods, much like the Java or Python package namespace. So
     |  in the instance given above, channel names might be "input" for the upper
     |  level, and "input.csv", "input.xls" and "input.gnu" for the sub-levels.
     |  There is no arbitrary limit to the depth of nesting.

     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, name, level=0)
     |      Initialize the logger with a name and an optional level.

     |      Add the specified handler to this logger.
     |  
     |  callHandlers(self, record)
     |      Pass a record to all relevant handlers.
     |      
     |      Loop through all handlers for this logger and its parents in the
     |      logger hierarchy. If no handler was found, output a one-off error
     |      message to sys.stderr. Stop searching up the hierarchy whenever a
     |      logger with the "propagate" attribute set to zero is found - that
     |      will be the last logger whose handlers are called.
     |  
     |  critical(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Log 'msg % args' with severity 'CRITICAL'.
     |      
     |      To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with
     |      a true value, e.g.
     |      
     |      logger.critical("Houston, we have a %s", "major disaster", exc_info=1)
     |  
     |  debug(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Log 'msg % args' with severity 'DEBUG'.
     |      
     |      To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with
     |      a true value, e.g.
     |      
     |      logger.debug("Houston, we have a %s", "thorny problem", exc_info=1)
     |  
     |  error(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Log 'msg % args' with severity 'ERROR'.

     |      Convenience method for logging an ERROR with exception information.
     |  
     |  fatal = critical(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  findCaller(self, stack_info=False)
     |      Find the stack frame of the caller so that we can note the source
     |      file name, line number and function name.
     |  
     |  getChild(self, suffix)
     |      Get a logger which is a descendant to this one.
     |      
     |      This is a convenience method, such that
     |      
     |      logging.getLogger('abc').getChild('def.ghi')
     |      
     |      is the same as
     |      
     |      logging.getLogger('abc.def.ghi')
     |      
     |      It's useful, for example, when the parent logger is named using
     |      __name__ rather than a literal string.
     |  
     |  getEffectiveLevel(self)
     |      Get the effective level for this logger.
     |      
     |      Loop through this logger and its parents in the logger hierarchy,

     |  
     |  handle(self, record)
     |      Call the handlers for the specified record.
     |      
     |      This method is used for unpickled records received from a socket, as
     |      well as those created locally. Logger-level filtering is applied.
     |  
     |  hasHandlers(self)
     |      See if this logger has any handlers configured.
     |      
     |      Loop through all handlers for this logger and its parents in the
     |      logger hierarchy. Return True if a handler was found, else False.
     |      Stop searching up the hierarchy whenever a logger with the "propagate"
     |      attribute set to zero is found - that will be the last logger which
     |      is checked for the existence of handlers.
     |  
     |  info(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Log 'msg % args' with severity 'INFO'.
     |      
     |      To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with
     |      a true value, e.g.
     |      
     |      logger.info("Houston, we have a %s", "interesting problem", exc_info=1)
     |  
     |  isEnabledFor(self, level)
     |      Is this logger enabled for level 'level'?
     |  
     |  log(self, level, msg, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Log 'msg % args' with the integer severity 'level'.
     |      
     |      To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with
     |      a true value, e.g.
     |      
     |      logger.log(level, "We have a %s", "mysterious problem", exc_info=1)
     |  
     |  makeRecord(self, name, level, fn, lno, msg, args, exc_info, func=None, extra=None, sinfo=None)
     |      A factory method which can be overridden in subclasses to create
     |      specialized LogRecords.
     |  
     |  removeHandler(self, hdlr)
     |      Remove the specified handler from this logger.
     |  
     |  setLevel(self, level)
     |      Set the logging level of this logger.  level must be an int or a str.

     |  warning(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Log 'msg % args' with severity 'WARNING'.
     |      
     |      To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with
     |      a true value, e.g.

     |      Determine if a record is loggable by consulting all the filters.
     |      
     |      The default is to allow the record to be logged; any filter can veto
     |      this and the record is then dropped. Returns a zero value if a record
     |      is to be dropped, else non-zero.

     |  __init__(self, logger, extra)
     |      Initialize the adapter with a logger and a dict-like object which

     |      easy stacking of LoggerAdapters, if so desired.
     |      
     |      You can effectively pass keyword arguments as shown in the
     |      following example:

     |      Is this logger enabled for level 'level'?
     |  
     |  log(self, level, msg, *args, **kwargs)

     |      contextual information from this adapter instance.
     |  
     |  process(self, msg, kwargs)
     |      Process the logging message and keyword arguments passed in to

     |  This handler does nothing. It's intended to be used to avoid the
     |  "No handlers could be found for logger XXX" one-off warning. This is
     |  important for library code, which may contain code to log events. If a user
     |  of the library does not configure logging, the one-off warning might be
     |  produced; to avoid this, the library developer simply needs to instantiate
     |  a NullHandler and add it to the top-level logger of the library module or
     |  package.

     |      
     |      This version removes the handler from an internal map of handlers,
     |      _handlers, which is used for handler lookup by name. Subclasses
     |      should ensure that this gets called from overridden close()

     |  handleError(self, record)
     |      Handle errors which occur during an emit() call.
     |      
     |      This method should be called from handlers when an exception is
     |      encountered during an emit() call. If raiseExceptions is false,
     |      exceptions get silently ignored. This is what is mostly wanted
     |      for a logging system - most users will not care about errors in

     |  
     |  addFilter(self, filter)
     |      Add the specified filter to this handler.
     |  
     |  filter(self, record)
     |      Determine if a record is loggable by consulting all the filters.
     |      
     |      The default is to allow the record to be logged; any filter can veto
     |      this and the record is then dropped. Returns a zero value if a record
     |      is to be dropped, else non-zero.
     |      
     |      .. versionchanged:: 3.2
     |      
     |         Allow filters to be just callables.
     |  
     |  removeFilter(self, filter)
     |      Remove the specified filter from this handler.

FUNCTIONS
    addLevelName(level, levelName)
        Associate 'levelName' with 'level'.
        
        This is used when converting levels to text during message formatting.
    
    basicConfig(**kwargs)
        Do basic configuration for the logging system.
        
        This function does nothing if the root logger already has handlers
        configured. It is a convenience method intended for use by simple scripts
        to do one-shot configuration of the logging package.
        
        The default behaviour is to create a StreamHandler which writes to
        sys.stderr, set a formatter using the BASIC_FORMAT format string, and
        add the handler to the root logger.
        
        A number of optional keyword arguments may be specified, which can alter
        the default behaviour.
        
        filename  Specifies that a FileHandler be created, using the specified
                  filename, rather than a StreamHandler.
        filemode  Specifies the mode to open the file, if filename is specified
                  (if filemode is unspecified, it defaults to 'a').
        format    Use the specified format string for the handler.
        datefmt   Use the specified date/time format.
        style     If a format string is specified, use this to specify the
                  type of format string (possible values '%', '{', '$', for
                  %-formatting, :meth:`str.format` and :class:`string.Template`
                  - defaults to '%').
        level     Set the root logger level to the specified level.
        stream    Use the specified stream to initialize the StreamHandler. Note
                  that this argument is incompatible with 'filename' - if both
                  are present, 'stream' is ignored.
        handlers  If specified, this should be an iterable of already created
                  handlers, which will be added to the root handler. Any handler
                  in the list which does not have a formatter assigned will be
                  assigned the formatter created in this function.
        
        Note that you could specify a stream created using open(filename, mode)
        rather than passing the filename and mode in. However, it should be
        remembered that StreamHandler does not close its stream (since it may be
        using sys.stdout or sys.stderr), whereas FileHandler closes its stream
        when the handler is closed.
        
        .. versionchanged:: 3.2
           Added the ``style`` parameter.
        
        .. versionchanged:: 3.3
           Added the ``handlers`` parameter. A ``ValueError`` is now thrown for
           incompatible arguments (e.g. ``handlers`` specified together with
           ``filename``/``filemode``, or ``filename``/``filemode`` specified
           together with ``stream``, or ``handlers`` specified together with
           ``stream``.
    
    captureWarnings(capture)
        If capture is true, redirect all warnings to the logging package.
        If capture is False, ensure that warnings are not redirected to logging
        but to their original destinations.
    
    critical(msg, *args, **kwargs)
        Log a message with severity 'CRITICAL' on the root logger. If the logger
        has no handlers, call basicConfig() to add a console handler with a
        pre-defined format.
    
    debug(msg, *args, **kwargs)
        Log a message with severity 'DEBUG' on the root logger. If the logger has
        no handlers, call basicConfig() to add a console handler with a pre-defined
        format.
    
    disable(level)
        Disable all logging calls of severity 'level' and below.
    
    error(msg, *args, **kwargs)
        Log a message with severity 'ERROR' on the root logger. If the logger has
        no handlers, call basicConfig() to add a console handler with a pre-defined
        format.
    
    exception(msg, *args, exc_info=True, **kwargs)
        Log a message with severity 'ERROR' on the root logger, with exception
        information. If the logger has no handlers, basicConfig() is called to add
        a console handler with a pre-defined format.
    
    fatal = critical(msg, *args, **kwargs)
        Log a message with severity 'CRITICAL' on the root logger. If the logger
        has no handlers, call basicConfig() to add a console handler with a
        pre-defined format.
    
    getLevelName(level)
        Return the textual representation of logging level 'level'.
        
        If the level is one of the predefined levels (CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING,
        INFO, DEBUG) then you get the corresponding string. If you have
        associated levels with names using addLevelName then the name you have
        associated with 'level' is returned.
        
        If a numeric value corresponding to one of the defined levels is passed
        in, the corresponding string representation is returned.
        
        Otherwise, the string "Level %s" % level is returned.
    
    getLogRecordFactory()
        Return the factory to be used when instantiating a log record.
    
    getLogger(name=None)
        Return a logger with the specified name, creating it if necessary.
        
        If no name is specified, return the root logger.
    
    getLoggerClass()
        Return the class to be used when instantiating a logger.
    
    info(msg, *args, **kwargs)
        Log a message with severity 'INFO' on the root logger. If the logger has
        no handlers, call basicConfig() to add a console handler with a pre-defined
        format.
    
    log(level, msg, *args, **kwargs)
        Log 'msg % args' with the integer severity 'level' on the root logger. If
        the logger has no handlers, call basicConfig() to add a console handler
        with a pre-defined format.
    
    makeLogRecord(dict)
        Make a LogRecord whose attributes are defined by the specified dictionary,
        This function is useful for converting a logging event received over
        a socket connection (which is sent as a dictionary) into a LogRecord
        instance.
    
    setLogRecordFactory(factory)
        Set the factory to be used when instantiating a log record.
        
        :param factory: A callable which will be called to instantiate
        a log record.
    
    setLoggerClass(klass)
        Set the class to be used when instantiating a logger. The class should
        define __init__() such that only a name argument is required, and the
        __init__() should call Logger.__init__()
    
    shutdown(handlerList=[<weakref at 0x7f3edfb9e548; to '_StderrHandler' at 0x7f3edfb9b240>])
        Perform any cleanup actions in the logging system (e.g. flushing
        buffers).
        
        Should be called at application exit.
    
    warn(msg, *args, **kwargs)
    
    warning(msg, *args, **kwargs)
        Log a message with severity 'WARNING' on the root logger. If the logger has
        no handlers, call basicConfig() to add a console handler with a pre-defined
        format.
